<!-- HTML Comments -->
HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.

<!-- HTML comment tag -->
You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:
<!-- Write yout comments here -->

<!-- Add Comments  -->
With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML code:
<!-- This is a comment -->
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<!-- Remember to add more information here -->

<!-- Hide Content -->
Comments can be used to hide content.
This can be helpful if you hide content temporarily:
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
<!-- <p>This is another paragraph</p> -->
<p>This is a paragraph too.</p>

You can also hide more than one line. Everything between the <!-- and the --> will be hiddren from the display.
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<!--
<p>Look at this cool image:</p>
<img border="0" src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Trulli">
-->
<p>This is a paragraph too.</p>

Comments are also great for debugging HTML, because you can comment out HTML lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors.

<!-- Hide Inline Content -->
Comments can be used to hide parts in the middle of the HtML code.
<p>This <!-- great text --> is a paragraph.</p>
