<!-- HTMl <picture> Element -->
The HTML <picture> element allows you to display different pictures for different devices or screen sizes.
The HTML <picture> Element gives web developers more flexibility in specifying image resources.
The <picture> element countains one or more <source> elements, each referring to differernt images
through srcset attribute. This way the browser can choose the image that best fits the current view and/or device.
Each <source> element has a media attribute that defines when the image is the most suitable.
<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="img1.jpg">
  <source media="(min-width: 465px)" srcset="img2.jpg">
  <img src="img.jpg" alt="alternative">
</picture>

Note: Always specify an <img> element as the last child element of the <picture> element. The <img> element is used by browsers that do not support the <picture> element, or if none of the <source> tags match.

<!-- When to use the Picture Element -->
There are two main purposes for the <picture> element:
1. Bandwidth: If you have a small screen or device, it is not necessary to load a large image file. The browser will use the first <source> element with matching attribute values, and ignore any of the following elements.
1. Format Support: Some browsers or devices may not support all image formats. By using the <picture> element, you can add images of all formats, and the browser will use the first format it recognizes, and ignore any of the followinig elements.
  <picture>
    <source srcset="img1.jpg">
    <source srcset="img2.png">
    <img src="img.gif" alt="alternative">
  </picture>

Note: The browser will use the first <source> element with matching attribute values, and ignore any following <source> element.
