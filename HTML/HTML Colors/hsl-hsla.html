<!-- HTML HSL and HSLA Colors -->
HSL stands for hue, saturation, and ligghtness.
HSLA color values are an extension of HSL with Alpha channel (opacity).

<!-- HSL Color Values -->
In HTML a color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) in the form:
hsl(hue, saturation, ligghtness)
Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 260. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 2240 is blue.
Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.
Lightness is also a percentage value. 0% is black, and 100% is white.
hsl(0, 100%, 50%)

<!-- Saturation -->
Saturation can be described as the intensity of a color.
100% is pure color, no shades of gray.
50% is 50% gray, but you can still see the color.
0% is completly gray; you can no longer see the color.

<!-- Lightness -->
The lightness of a color can be described as how much light you want to give the color, where 0% means no light (black), 50% means 50% light (neither dark or light), and 100% means full lightness (white).

<!-- Shades of Gray -->
Shades of gray are often defined by setting the hue and saturation to 0, and adjusting the lightness fromr 0% to 100% to get darker/lighter shades:
hsl(0, 0%, 20%)
hsl(0, 0%, 30%)
hsl(0, 0%, 40%)
hsl(0, 0%, 60%)
hsl(0, 0%, 70%)
hsl(0, 0%, 90%)

<!-- HSLA Color Values -->
HSLA color values are an extension of HSL color values, with an Alpha channel - which specifies the opacity of a color.
An HSLA color value is speccified with:
hsla(hue, saturation, ligghtness, alpha)
The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all).
hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0)
hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5)
hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 1)
