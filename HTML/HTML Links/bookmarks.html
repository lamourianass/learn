<!-- HTML Links - Create Bookmarks -->
HTML links can be used to create bookmarks, so that readers can jump to specific parts of a web page.

<!-- Create a Bookmark in HTML -->
Bookmarks can be useful if a webpage is very long.
To create a bookmark - first create the bookmark, then add a link to it.
When the link is clicked, the page will scroll down or up to the location with the bookmark.
First, use the id attribute to create a bookmark:
<h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>
Then, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from within the same page:
<a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>
You can also add a link to a bookmark on another page:
<a href="html_demo.html#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>
