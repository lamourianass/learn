<!-- HTML Element -->
The HTML element is everything from the start tag, some content, and an end tag.
<tagname>Content...</tagname>

Exemple of some HTML elements:
<h1>My first heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph</p>

<!-- Nested HTML Elements -->
HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).
All HTML documents consist of nested elements.
The following example contains four HTML elements (<html>, <body>, <h1> and <p>):

  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <body>
      <h1>My First Heading</h1>
      <p>My first paragraph.</p>
    </body>
  </html>

The <html> is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.
It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>
Then, inside the <html> element there is a <body> element:

The <body> element defines the document's body.
It has a start tag <body> and an end tag </body>.
Then, inside the <body> element there are two other elements: <h1> and <p>

The <h1> element defines a heading.
It has a start tag <h1> and an end tag </h1>

The <p> element defines a paragraphe.
It has a start tag <p> and an end tag </p>

<!-- Never Skip the End Tag -->

Sone HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag:

<html>
  <body>
    <p>This is a paragraph
    <p>This is a paragraph
  </body>
</html>

However, never rely on this! Unexpected results and errors may occur if you forget the end tag!

<!-- Empty HTML Elements -->

HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
the <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:
<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>

<!-- HTML is Not Case Sensitive -->
HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>
