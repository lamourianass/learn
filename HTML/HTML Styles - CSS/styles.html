<!-- HTML Styles - CSS -->
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.

<!-- What is CSS -->
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.
With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and layout, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!
Tip: The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to blue, all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!

<!-- Using CSS -->
CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
* Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
* Internal - by using <style></style> element in the <head></head> section
* External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file.

The most common way yo add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files.

<!-- Inline CSS -->
An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.
An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.
The following example sets the text color of the <h1> element to blue, and the text color of the <p>
<h1 style="color:blue;">A Blue Heading</h1>
<p style="color:red;">A red paragraph.</p>

<!-- Internal CSS -->
An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.
An internal CSS is defined in the <head></head> section of an HTML page, within a <style></style> element.
The following example sets the text color of ALL the <h1> elements (on that page) to blue, and the text color of ALL the <p> elements to red. In addition, the page will be displayed with a "powderblue"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
  body {background-color:powderblue;}
  h1 {color:blue;}
  p {color:red;}
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Thi is a heading</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph</p>
</body>
</html>

<!-- External CSS -->
An external Style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML page:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>

The external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The file must not contain any HTML code, and must be saved with a .css extension.
Here is what the "style.css" file looks like:
body {
  background-color: powderblue;
}
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
}
Tip: Whit an external ss, you can change the look of an entire website, by changing one file!

<!-- CSS Colors, Fonts and Sizes -->
Here, we will demonstrate some commonly used CSS properties. You will learn more about them later.
The CSS color property defines the text color to be used.
The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used.
The CSS font-size property defines the text size to be used.

Use of CSS color, font-family and font-size properties:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      h1 {
        color: blue;
        font-family: verdana;
        font-size: 300%;
      }
      p {
        color: red;
        font-family: courier;
        font-size: 160%;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- CSS Border -->
The CSS border property defines a border around an HTML element.
Tip: You can define a border for nearly all HTML elements.
p {
  border: 2px solid powderblue;
}

<!-- CSS Pading -->
The CSS pading property defines a padding (space) between the text and the border.
p {
  border: 2px solid powderblue;
  padding: 30px;
}

<!-- CSS Margin -->
The CSS margin property defines a margin (space) outside the border:
p {
  border: 2px solid powderblue;
  margin: 50px;
}

<!-- Link to external CSS -->
External style sheets can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
